# Password-Generator

## Description

This application allows users to generate secure passwords by selecting various criteria, including password length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters). The generated password is then displayed in an alert. 

The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

  - Length is validated to be at least 8 characters but no more than 128.
  - Character types include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.
- Validated each input to ensure accurate and secure password generation.
- Ensured at least one character type is selected before generating a password.
- Displayed the generated password in an alert for user convenience.
- Deployed the application, making it accessible for password generation.
- Maintained a clean and polished user interface for an intuitive experience.
- Followed best practices for file structure, naming conventions, and code quality.
- Provided a comprehensive README with project details, live application link, and GitHub repository information.
- Included screenshots to visually represent the generated password.
